            The overarching goal of this project was to develop a model capable of classifying these submissions by sentiment, allowing for detailed analysis of the sentiments associated with different carnivore species sighted.  
            I plan on continually updating this repo as we make progress with this sentiment analysis. A major challenge was the severe class imbalance of positive and negative submissions.  
            In order to assess how the model performs before acquiring more data, a series of tests was done on different text datasets with varying class balances.  
            The model achieved its highest performance with 81% accuracy, with a balanced accuracy rate between positive and negative comments.

                The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare forecasting methods to achieve the highest accuracy forecast of the monthly revenue of Harrah's 
                casino located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The models considered are ARIMA, ETS, GARCH, and Meta's Prophet. This dataset posed an interesting problem 
                as it contains two back-to-back outliers. One was a result of COVID lockdown in the spring of 2020 and the second was a result of Hurricane Ida the following 
                year. Outlier detection and imputation was done to handle these shocks.

                The dataset was created from the monthly revenue reports provided by the <a href="https://lgcb.dps.louisiana.gov" target="_blank">Louisiana Gaming Control Board</a>. 
                The dataset is composed of the reported monthly gross gaming revenue from Harrah's casino spanning from January 2007 to September 2024, totaling 213 data points.

                  Imputation was done for observed outliers that resulted from two significant drops in revenue. First was the result of COVID lockdowns in 2020. A stay-at-home order 
                  was implemented in March 23, 2020 as a result Harrah's monthly revenue in the March of 2020 was 64% less than March of the previous year. Harrah's reported zero revenue 
                  for the months of April and May after the lockdowns continued to be in effect. Harrah's reopened when the state transistion to phase 2 of reopening on June 5th, 
                  2020[wikipedia]. In the month of June Harrah's reported a revenue that was 75% less than the same month in the previous year.

                  <p>
                    In dealing with COVID era data I considered a few options, the simplest being keeping the COVID era data, removing it, or imputation. I also considered creating a 
                    dummy varaible for pre-COVID data and post-COVID data, but the difficulty in that was defining when post-COVID begins. Also, from our data we can see that by 
                    the following March 2021, it had returned to pre-lockdown revenues until there was dramatic dip again starting August of 2021. This was likely due to hurricane Ida 
                    which caused widespread power outages, wind damage, localized flooding. Many residents decided to evacuate the area before the storm.
                  </p>

                <p>
                  I decided to imputate, the R package 'tsoutliers' automatically detects outliers and suggests values for replacement. The function determined revenues in April 2020 
                  and May of 2020, both zero, to be the only outliers and suggested replacements. Figure 2 is the data after imputation.

                  All models except prophet was done in R. The prophet model was built using python programming. In order to use the ARMA model the data needs to be stationary, where the 
                  mean and variance is constant across time and autocovariance, which is the difference between values at different time lags depends on the lag and not the specific time. 
                  An Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, ADF test, was conducted on the imputed and logged data to check for stationarity. The following is the result of our ADF test. 
                </p>

                  Our test statistic tells us how far the data is from a unit root. A unit root is a stochastic trend in a time series that indicate that a value will be highly dependent 
                  on its past values, the presence of a unit root indicates that it is non-stationary. The negative number suggests that it further far a unit root.  Our alternative 
                  hypothesis is stationarity, our p-value is <0.05 so we can reject the null-hypothesis which is that it is non-stationary.

                  <p>
                    An ACF plot however shows a more gradual decline to zero which suggests non-stationarity. When the data is differenced an ADF test still the ACF no longer suggests 
                    non-stationarity, however the PACF still has several significant spikes.

                      The autocorrelation function, acf, plot shows suggest that an autoregressive, AR, model may be appropriate. The partial autocorrelation function, PACF, 
                      plot suggests that it may be of order 1 or higher. The autocorrelation function, acf, plot shows suggest that an autoregressive, AR, model may be appropriate. 
                      The partial autocorrelation function, PACF, plot suggests that it may be of order 1 or higher. The ETS and Prophet models do not require stationarity, as it models trends, 
                      seasonality and other non-stationary underlying structures directly. So an ADF test is no necessary.

                  The first training set is composed of 90% of our data and the test set is the remaining 10%.  Cross validation was done by creating multiple training 
                  sets from the training set. The first training set will to forecast each subsequent data point, the next training set will add the next datapoint in 
                  the series creating a data set of 171 observations, the next 172, and so on. Forecast accuracy is computed by averaging over the test

                    In addition to the cross-validation results, I looked at innovation residuals to evaluate these forecasting methods. What we look for are residuals 
                    that are uncorrelated which tells us that the models have captured all the information from the data. The other important properties is to see if 
                    residuals center around zero which tells us whether the forecast is biased or not.

                    For the prophet model, I manually plotted the residuals to inspect for a mean around zero. Figure 10 is the residual plot from the Prophet Model. 
                    Apart from the outliers as a result of shocks from COVID and Hurricane IDA it does stay fairly centered around zero for all models.

          The objective of this project was develop a model that could predict recidivism among parolees and identify key factors that contributing to repeat offenses, with the goal of informing policies that reduce the likelihood of reoffending. 
          A focus was made on not only accuracy but importantly reducing the rates of false positive. Gradient boosting and SVM models are developed for this purpose. 
          A binary and multi-class classification gradient boosting models were used to indicate if a person would reoffend and if so would they reoffend in one, two or three years. 
          Both the binary and multi-class classification models indicated similar top variables for determining recidivism. The top two variables were percentage of days employed and jobs per year. 
          Gang affiliation, average number of days on parole between drug tests and supervision score also ranked high in the models. Of the three SVM models run (linear, radial basis and polynomial kernels), 
          the linear SVM produced the highest accuracy rate and the lowest false positive rate.
