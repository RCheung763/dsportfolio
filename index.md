## About me 

Hello there, I'm Ruby! I am a student in my final year of the MS Data Science program at Seattle University. I am very excited for graduation this coming spring. I also have a bachelor's in Economics from St. Catherine University. Currently I am the Insitutional Research Analyst at Wabash College located in Indiana. I am also working as graduate research assistant in the mathmatics department at Seattle U. I have a total of 5 years of experience in research and analytical work. 

I have worked on projects in a variety of subject areas using structured and unstructured data. Some memorable projects include The Sudan Panel Survey and working with the St. Paul Public School System studying the affects of early start times. I am passionate about machine learning, building predictive models, experimenting with cutting edge AI tools, extracting actionable insights, and data storytelling.  

I am excited to share some of my work with you. Please do not hesitate to reach out to connect!
